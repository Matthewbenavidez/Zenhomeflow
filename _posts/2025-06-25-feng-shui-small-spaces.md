Living in a small space doesn’t mean you can’t have big energy. Feng Shui principles can help you make even the tiniest apartment or room feel more open, balanced, and welcoming.

## 🛋️ Keep the Flow Open

Avoid blocking walkways or placing large furniture near doors. Allow space for energy (and you!) to move freely.

## 🪞Use Mirrors Wisely

Strategically placed mirrors expand space and reflect light. Just avoid placing them across from clutter or beds.

## 🗃️ Declutter Constantly

Clutter traps energy and creates mental fog. Use smart storage, baskets, and minimalist decor to stay tidy and clear.

## 🌱 Add Vertical Elements

Use shelves, hanging plants, or vertical wall art to draw the eye upward. This helps create a sense of expansion.

## 🌈 Use Light Colors and Soft Textures

Light walls, rugs, and bedding make rooms feel airy. Soft textures (cotton, linen, bamboo) create calming flow.
