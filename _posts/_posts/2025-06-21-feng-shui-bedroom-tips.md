Your bedroom should be your sanctuary — a place of rest, intimacy, and calm energy. Feng Shui offers practical guidance to balance the energy in your bedroom for better sleep and emotional well-being.

## 1. Position Your Bed with a Commanding View
Avoid placing your bed directly in line with the door. Instead, position it so you can see the door while lying down — but not directly facing it. This brings a sense of control and safety.

## 2. Keep Electronics to a Minimum
Electromagnetic energy can disrupt sleep. Keep phones, TVs, and laptops out of the bedroom or far from your bed when sleeping.

## 3. Use Pairs in Décor
Use pairs of lamps, pillows, and nightstands — especially if you're in a relationship or want one. It symbolizes balance and equality.

## 4. Declutter Under Your Bed
Avoid storing anything under your bed — especially sharp, emotional, or chaotic items. Energy should flow freely under and around your bed.

## 5. Choose Soft, Earthy Tones
Colors like beige, taupe, and soft greens promote calm. Avoid bright reds or harsh whites in the bedroom.
