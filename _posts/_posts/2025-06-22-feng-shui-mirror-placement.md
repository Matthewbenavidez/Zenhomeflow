Mirrors are powerful tools in Feng Shui — they reflect energy, expand space, and influence emotions. But when used incorrectly, they can disrupt harmony in your home.

## ✅ Best Practices

### 1. Use Mirrors to Expand Light and Space
Place mirrors in areas that feel dark or cramped to reflect light and create a more open feel.

### 2. Reflect Beautiful Views
Position mirrors to reflect pleasant scenery, plants, or artwork. This doubles the positive energy in the space.

### 3. Use a Frame
Unframed mirrors can feel cold or chaotic. Choose mirrors with rounded or wood frames to soften the energy.

## ❌ What to Avoid

### 1. Mirror Facing the Bed
This can disturb sleep or create energetic restlessness. Move or cover it at night if unavoidable.

### 2. Facing Another Mirror
Two mirrors facing each other bounce energy back and forth — it creates chaotic “mirror wars.”

### 3. Reflecting Clutter
A mirror that reflects a pile of laundry, cords, or a messy space doubles the mess — and the stress.

**Suggested Feng Shui Mirrors:**
- Round wood-framed mirror for calm energy  
- Standing floor mirror for small entryways  
- Decorative octagonal Bagua mirror (for exterior use only)

> Tip: Before placing a mirror, ask “What energy am I doubling in this space?”
