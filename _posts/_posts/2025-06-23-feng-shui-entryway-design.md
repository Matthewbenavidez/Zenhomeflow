Your entryway is where energy (Chi) enters your home — it's the first impression for both visitors and opportunities. Feng Shui treats the front entrance as the “mouth of Chi,” making it a powerful zone to get right.

## 🚪 Clear the Path

Make sure the area around your front door is tidy and clutter-free. Sweep regularly, remove shoes or boxes, and allow space for energy to enter.

## 🪞Avoid Facing Mirrors

A mirror directly facing the front door pushes energy back out. Instead, place it on the side wall to “pull” Chi into the home.

## 🌿 Add Life with Plants

Use a healthy plant or flower arrangement in your entry to welcome abundance and growth. Avoid sharp, spiky plants here (like cactus).

## 🔆 Light It Well

Bright, warm lighting at the entry helps attract positive energy. Dim or broken lights signal neglect.

## 🖼️ Include Meaningful Décor

Hang a piece of art, a calming image, or an inspiring quote to greet guests and energy alike.
