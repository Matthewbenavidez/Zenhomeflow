Plants arenâ€™t just decorative â€” theyâ€™re energy transformers in Feng Shui. The right plants invite abundance, health, and peace into your space, while the wrong ones can block growth or create imbalance.

## ðŸŒ¿ Best Feng Shui Plants

### 1. **Money Tree (Pachira Aquatica)**
Symbolizes wealth and prosperity. Place it in the southeast (wealth) area of your home or office.

### 2. **Jade Plant**
Known for attracting success and friendship. Ideal for entryways or small offices.

### 3. **Areca Palm**
Excellent air purifier and creates a soft energy flow â€” great for living rooms and large spaces.

### 4. **Peace Lily**
Brings calm, cleans air, and symbolizes purity. Perfect for bedrooms and bathrooms.

### 5. **Snake Plant (Mother-in-lawâ€™s Tongue)**
Contrary to popular belief, this plant brings grounded energy when placed properly â€” best in corners or by doorways.
