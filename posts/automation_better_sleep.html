    <h2>Automation for Better Sleep</h2>
    <p class="post-date">Published on June 18, 2025</p>

    <p>Sleep is foundational to health and clarity. Yet many of us struggle to unwind and transition smoothly into rest. Smart home technology can help ease this process by automating your wind-down routine and creating a restful environment with minimal effort.</p>

    <h3>1. Wind-Down Lighting Routines</h3>
    <p>Set your smart lights to gradually dim 30–60 minutes before bedtime. Use warm hues (like amber or soft red) to signal to your brain that it’s time to relax and prepare for sleep.</p>

    <h3>2. Ambient Sounds or Sleep Music</h3>
    <p>Use a smart speaker or sleep assistant to play calming music, white noise, or guided meditations. Schedule it to start automatically around your bedtime.</p>

    <h3>3. Climate Control for Comfort</h3>
    <p>Program your smart thermostat to lower the temperature slightly in the evening. A cooler environment (65–68°F) is ideal for deep, uninterrupted sleep.</p>

    <h3>4. Screen-Free Zones with Smart Plugs</h3>
    <p>Use smart plugs to power down screens or LED lights in your bedroom after a certain time. This encourages a blue-light-free space for rest.</p>

    <h3>5. Automated Diffusers</h3>
    <p>Pair a smart plug with a diffuser that releases calming scents like lavender or chamomile before bed. Schedule it to run for 30 minutes to trigger a relaxing sensory cue.</p>

    <p>These small, automated actions can stack up to create a sleep environment that’s inviting, consistent, and effective. With a bit of thoughtful tech, your bedtime can become one of the most calming parts of your day.</p>
